# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

Visualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll 
create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a 
multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that
summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

-The most rides are in urban cities compared to Suburban and Rural areas. 
-The most drivers are in cities compared to Surburban and rural areas, which should not be a suprise since most rides are as well. 
-Rural areas are most expensive for average fare. I would assume this is because of less drivers and less demand.
